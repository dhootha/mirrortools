Introduction
============
mirrortools is a set of stored procedures that allows the easy manipulation and management of a collection of mirrored databases on Microsoft SQL Server 2005+. For example, if we wanted to setup a new mirrored database, weâ€™d just need to run:

  mirrotools copy, database_name
  mirrortools mirror, database_name

or if we wanted to failover all the databases on the server, we could run::

  mirrortools failover

Commands
========

Commands available through *mirrortools* procedure:

    * FAILOVER: failover group of databases to mirroring partner
    * FORCE: performs forced failover to group of databases
    * SUSPEND: suspends mirroring for group of databases
    * RESUME: resumes mirroring on group of suspended databases
    * COPY: copies database from principal to mirror in order to be mirrrored
    * MIRROR: mirrors database once copied to mirror using High Availability model
    * MIRNOWIT: mirrors database once copied to mirror using High Protection model
    * KILLMIR: removes mirroring session for group of databases
    * AUTO_FAILOVER_ON: Sets group of databases to High-Safety with Auto Failover
    * AUTO_FAILOVER_OFF: Sets group of databases to High-Safety without Auto Failover
    * RECOVER: sets databases in 'restoring...' mode to be usable
    * SYNCLOGIN: synchronizes group of logins from principal to mirror
    * PARTNERDO: Executes t-sql command on partner instance of sql server
    * PARTNERDROP: Drops particular (single) database on partner server
    * STATUS: Displays current database mirroring status
    * HELP: Shows this help file...

There are also several additional procedures which are called via mirrortools or can be called directly:

execute_job
-----------

`execute_job` executes a SQL Server Agent Job in a blocking fashion (does not return until job returns).

sync_logins
-----------

`sync_logins` transfers a comma delimited list of logins from the origin server to another SQL Server. The procedure respects SIDs, passwords, and server-level roles.

hung_job_catcher
----------------

`hung_job_catcher` checks for jobs that have been running for greater than a defined period of time and alerts the operators associated with the job.
